# PiDuino

Arduino on Pi boards, the best of both worlds.

## Abstract

PiDuino was born from a question from one of my students who asked me why programming input-output on NanoPi was not as simple as on [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).

**This project is under development, you can see the work being done in the [dev branch](https://github.com/epsilonrt/piduino/tree/dev).**
