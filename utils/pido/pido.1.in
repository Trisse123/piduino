.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpido\fR is a command line tool to allow the user easy access to the GPIO pins
on a Pi board. It's designed for simple testing and diagnostic purposes, but can 
be used in shell scripts for general if somewhat slow control of the GPIO pins.

\fBpido\fR use the piduino library https://github.com/epsilonrt/piduino, board 
model detection is automatic and uses a database allowing a simple user to add 
a new Pi board "variant" \fBwithout\fR programming.

.TP
\fBmode\fR \fIpin\fR [\fBin\fR | \fBout\fR | \fBoff\fR | \fBpwm\fR | \fBalt{0..9}\fR]
Gets the current mode if no value is supplied.

Sets a pin into \fIinput\fR, \fIoutput\fR, \fIpwm\fR, \fIalt{0..9}\fR or \fIoff\fR mode. 
Disabling a pin with \fIoff\fR is only available on some SoC model (c.f. datasheet).

The ALT modes can also be set using \fIalt0\fR, \fIalt1\fR,  ... \fIalt9\fR.
The number of alternative modes available depends on the SoC model (c.f. datasheet).

.TP
\fBpull\fR \fIpin\fR [\fBup\fR | \fBdown\fR | \fBoff\fR]
Gets the current state of the resistor if no value is supplied. This feature is 
only available on some SoC models (c.f. datasheet).

Use \fIup\fR, \fIdown\fR or \fIoff\fR to set the internal pull-up, pull-down or 
off (tristate) controls.

.TP
\fBwrite\fR \fIpin\fR \fB0\fR | \fB1\fR
Write the given value (0 or 1) to the pin. You need to set the pin
to output mode first.

.TP
\fBtoggle\fR \fIpin\fR
Changes the state of a GPIO pin; 0 to 1, or 1 to 0. You need to set the pin
to output mode first.

.TP
\fBblink\fR \fIpin\fR [\fIms_period\fR]
Blinks the given pin on/off. Press Control-C to exit. The flashing period in 
milliseconds can be specified otherwise its default value is 1000 
(can not be less than 1 ms).

Note: This command explicitly sets the pin to output mode.

.TP
\fBpwm\fR \fIpin\fR \fIvalue\fR
Write a PWM value (0-1023) to the given pin. The pin needs to be put
into PWM mode first. The pin must have hardware PWM functionality (c.f. datasheet).

.TP
\fBread\fR \fIpin\fR
Read the digital value of the given pin and print 0 or 1 to represent the
respective logic levels.

.TP
\fBwfi\fR \fIpin\fR \fBrising\fR | \fBfalling\fR | \fBboth\fR [\fItimeout_ms\fR]
This set the given pin to the supplied interrupt mode: rising, falling
or both then waits for the interrupt to happen. It's a non-busy wait,
so does not consume and CPU while it's waiting.

.TP
\fBreadall\fR [\fIconnector\fR]
Output a table of all GPIO pins values. The values represent the actual values read
if the pin is in input mode, or the last value written if the pin is in output
mode. All connectors are displayed by default, to display only one connector, 
just specify its number (listed above the table).

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-g
Use the SoC pins numbers rather than PiDuino pin numbers.

.TP
.B \-1
Use the connector pin numbers rather than PiDuino pin numbers. A number is 
written in the form C.N, eg: 1.5 denotes pin 5 of connector 1.

.TP
.B \-s
Use the System pin numbers rather than PiDuino pin numbers.

.TP
.B \-f
Force to use SysFS interface (/sys/class/gpio) to control pin features.

.TP
.B \-v
Show the piduino version.

.TP
.B \-w
Show the warranty notice.

.TP
.B \-h
Show a short usage summary.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.RE
.PP
PIDUINO_CONN_INFO
.RS 4
If set, this variable allows the user to force the location of the PiDuino 
database used by pido. It supports SQLite3, MySQL, PostgreSQL as well as a 
connection to ODBC out of the box. See http://cppcms.com/sql/cppdb/connstr.html
for the syntax.

.SH FILES
.RE
.PP
/etc/piduino.conf
.RS 4
PiDuino configuration file to force the board model to use or to indicate the 
location of the PiDuino database.
.RE
.PP
@PIDUINO_INSTALL_DATA_DIR@/piduino.db
.RS 4
PiDuino local SQLite 3 database file by default.
 
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 2.2i
\fBpido mode\fR 0 \fBout\fR # Set pin 0 to output
.PP
The physical numbering in the form C.N, for example \fI1.11\fR, makes it 
possible to quickly designate the pin N (here 11) of the C connector (here 1).

The quickest way to get a list of the pin differences is to run the command :
.PP
\fBpido readall\fR
.PP
\fBpido mode\fR 1.11 \fBout\fR # Set pin 11 of connector 1 to output (same as pin 0 on NanoPi, RaspberryPi)
.PP
\fBpido write\fR 0 1 # Set pin 0 to high
.PP
\fBpido toggle\fR 0 # Toggle the state of pin 0
.PP
\fBpido blink\fR 0 100 # Blink pin 0 with a period of 100 ms
.PP
\fBpido mode\fR 0 \fBin\fR # Set pin 0 to input
.PP
\fBpido pull\fR 0 \fBup\fR # Set pin 0 pull-up resistor
.PP
\fBpido read\fR 0 # Read pin 0
.PP
\fBpido wfi\fR 0 \fBfalling\fR # Wait for an interruption on a falling edge of pin 0
