   * @class FileDevice
   * @brief Provides an interface for reading from and writing to files

    FileDevice is an I/O device for reading and writing binary and text
    files (with std::iostream features \sa FileDevice::ios()).

    The file name is usually passed in the constructor, but it can be
    set at any time using setFileName(). FileDevice expects the file
    separator to be '/' regardless of operating system.

    The file is opened with open(), closed with close().

    Data is usually read and written using std::iostream with ios(), but you can
    also call the functions read() and write().
