       * Sequential devices, as opposed to a random-access devices, have no
       * concept of a start, an end, a size, or a current position, and they
       * do not support seeking. You can only read from the device when it
       * reports that data is available. The most common example of a sequential
       * device is a network socket. On Unix, special files such as /dev/zero
       * and fifo pipes are sequential.
       *
       * Regular files, on the other hand, do support random access. They have
       * both a size and a current position, and they also support seeking
       * backwards and forwards in the data stream. Regular files are non-sequential.
       *
       * The IoDevice implementation returns false.
